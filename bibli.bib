abstract = "In this paper we investigate the complexity of finding various kinds of common super- and subsequences with respect to one or two given sets of strings. We show that Longest Minimal Common Supersequence, Shortest Maximal Common Subsequence, and Shortest Maximal Common Non-Supersequence are \{MAX\} SNP-hard over a binary alphabet. Moreover, we show that Shortest Common Supersequence, Longest Common Subsequence, Longest Common Non-Supersequence, Shortest Common Non-Subsequence, and Longest Minimal Common Non-Supersequence are \{MAX\} SNP-hard over a binary alphabet if the number of zeros is fixed (by the instance). We show how these problems can be related to finding sequences consistent with respect to two given sets of strings. This leads to a unified approach for characterizing the complexity of such problems. "

abstract = "This paper is concerned with counting permutations which do not contain certain subsequences. The number of even and odd such permutations is found and the involutions among them are counted. Bijections are determined between sets of such permutations and other combinatorial objects. A discussion is given of lattices whose maximum length chains correspond to restricted permutations. The results in this paper complement previous work by Knuth, Lovász, Rotem and Stanley. "
